# This is plates
## It's a DOM template engine

This is plates. It does DOM templates using the browsers' DOM parser. It can process data.

It is modular, so it can execute extension methods while copying the traversal tree.

It doesn't do many things out-of-the-box but you can have it do basically anything you'll need. I've written some examples.
